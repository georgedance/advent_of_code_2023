I accidentally deleted the original source code to beat part 1, 
that's why I've still got the original `[a.out](/bin/a.out)` and `[make.sh](/make.sh)`,
because it seems like Makefiles / make hates me.

I'm fairly satisfied with the code though. It was done in a decent time frame, and even accepts multiple files.
